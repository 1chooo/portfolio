# Acknowledgments

This project was made possible thanks to the generosity, creativity, and hard work of the open-source community. I'm deeply grateful to the developers, designers, and maintainers whose projects and ideas shaped and supported this work.

## Foundational Project

A special thanks to [@codewithsadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee) for the outstanding [vcard-personal-portfolio](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio). It served as the starting point and structural foundation for this site.

## Open Source Projects Used or Adapted

This project incorporates and adapts the following open-source libraries and tools:

* [**rehype**](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) — for transforming and processing HTML with plugins.
* [**remark**](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) — for Markdown processing in MDX content.
* [**Giscus**](https://giscus.app/) — for enabling GitHub Discussions-based comments.
* [**react-scroll-motion**](https://github.com/1000ship/react-scroll-motion) — for scroll-based animations and transitions.
* [**GitHub Calendar**](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-github-calendar) — for displaying contribution activity in a visual calendar format.

## Inspiration

Beyond tools, I drew design and UX inspiration from many exceptional personal sites and portfolios, including:

* [**nelsonlai.me**](https://nelsonlai.me)
* [**leerob.com**](https://leerob.com)
* [**bntw.dev**](https://bntw.dev)
* [**webtech-note.com**](https://webtech-note.com)
* [**michaelangelo.io**](https://michaelangelo.io)
* [**iamsahaj.xyz**](https://iamsahaj.xyz)
* [**jinrup.dev**](https://www.jinrup.dev)
* [**mt.ci**](https://mt.ci)

Each of these projects influenced aspects of the layout, interactions, animations, or content strategy.

## And Many More

There are countless other libraries, snippets, articles, and creators who indirectly helped me along the way — far too many to name, but no less appreciated.

Thank you to everyone who shares knowledge and code openly. This project stands on your shoulders.
