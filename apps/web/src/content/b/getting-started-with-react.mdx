# Getting Started with React

This is a test MDX post to demonstrate the experimental blog functionality.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's maintained by Facebook and has become one of the most popular frontend frameworks.

### Key Features

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Declarative**: Makes your code more predictable and easier to debug
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Can be used for web, mobile, and desktop applications

## Example Code

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

React is a powerful tool for building modern web applications. This MDX blog system allows us to write rich content with code examples and interactive elements.
