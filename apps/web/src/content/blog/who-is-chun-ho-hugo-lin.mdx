I'm an incoming student at University of Southern California ‚úåÔ∏è. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from National Central University üêøÔ∏è.

I would like to share the words I learned from various sources, recalling the time I first started learning algorithms. It was my first experience with coding and programming, and I didn't even know what data structures were. I had to do a lot of research to complete my homework, exploring textbooks, blogs, and tech articles shared by others, all within just one week.

During this process, I found that some resources couldn't help me solve the problems because I couldn't understand what the authors were trying to convey. Additionally, I lacked some domain knowledge. Therefore, consuming knowledge from various sources and filtering it was the best approach for me at the time. This allowed me to find materials that matched my learning pace in this new field.

That's why I started writing down the words I learned from books, articles, or any other resources. I want to provide another solution for others who are in the same position I once was. Perhaps these solutions or notes will help you find the answers you need or guide you to explore more knowledge.
