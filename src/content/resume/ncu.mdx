I completed my Bachelor of Science in Atmospheric Sciences, along with a minor specialization in Programming Design in Computer Science, at [National Central University (NCU)](https://www.ncu.edu.tw) in June 2024.

During my four years of undergraduate study, I built a strong foundation in atmospheric science, meteorology, and environmental analysis—developing the ability to interpret complex weather phenomena and work with large climate datasets. As a cross-disciplinary student, I also cultivated a deep interest in computer science and programming, integrating these skills into both my coursework and industry experience.

In addition, I served as a teaching assistant for five courses, supporting and guiding over 250 students across a variety of subjects, including:

- Student Service-Learning
- Freshman English
- Linux and Edge Computing
- Programming Python
- Weather and AI I/II

## Extracurricular Involvement

Outside of academics, I served as a project manager for a year-long initiative to build an orientation website for incoming freshmen. Working with the Design, Planning, and Programming departments, I used my engineering background to bridge communication across teams and ensure smooth collaboration.

Our team launched a new Blog feature that drew over 2,000 visitors per page. This experience strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and communication skills.
