I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), having commenced my studies in August 2025.

My interests span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing web development and improving the quality, reliability, and efficiency of large-scale software systems.

I am eager to deepen my knowledge and skills in these areas through advanced coursework and research opportunities at USC.
